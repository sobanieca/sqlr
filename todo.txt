figure out how to build connection string in most user friendly way (urlencode password for example)
  inside connector create method like:
  buildConnectionString(), which will ask one by one for server url, password, etc. and urlencode it

inside connection string hint users should more clearly see that password/username needs to be url encoded

sqlr connections
sqlr add-connection
sqlr rm-connection
sqlr get-connection
sqlr list-connectors
  postgres
  ms sql server
  mysql
sqlr describe [connection] -s "localhost:5341" -t postgres
sqlr query [connection] "select * from all"

-i input.sql
-o output.json
